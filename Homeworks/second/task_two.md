        One usually make assumptions for models in relation to real world systems, in order to simplify the actual workings of the system. Example of assumptions are:
        1. Customers will never quit a que.
        2. Changing which customers are being served is done instantenously. 
    </li>
    <li>
        After the model has been made and one tries to use it with historical data one goes into to the verification phase. In this phase one verifies whether the system actually works. Does it act as one intended it to. After that one moves over to the validation phase. I this phase one looks at the results and make an assessment whether these data seems probable.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the output from the model seems to be vastly different from the real world system, then this can indicate that the model hasn't been verified to a satisfying level.
